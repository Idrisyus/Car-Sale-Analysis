## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **interactive Car Sales Dashboard** built in **Power BI**.  
It analyzes car sales performance across **revenue, sales volume, customer preferences, and regional trends**.  

The main objective was to demonstrate **end-to-end data analytics skills**:  
- Data cleaning & shaping (Power Query)  
- KPI creation (DAX)  
- Dashboard design & storytelling  
- Generating **actionable business recommendations**

## 📊 Key Insights
From the analysis, several interesting patterns emerged:  
- 📈 **Revenue grew +23.6% YoY** → strong top-line growth  
- 📉 **Sales volume dropped -38%** → fewer customers buying cars  
- 🚙 **SUVs & Sedans dominate sales** → core volume drivers  
- 🎨 **Black & White cars are most popular** → customer preference trend  
- 📍 **Austin & Greenville dealerships outperform others** → regional strengths  
- 🏆 **Chevrolet & Ford lead sales**, while **Mercedes & Porsche dominate profit margins**

## 💡 Business Recommendations
Based on the insights, here’s what I would recommend as a data analyst:  
1. Revisit **pricing strategy** — revenue growth isn’t sustainable if customer base keeps shrinking.  
2. Double down on **SUVs & Sedans** while trimming less profitable body styles.  
3. Focus investment on **high-performing regions** and address weaker dealerships.  
4. Apply **customer segmentation**:  
   - Financing options for middle-income buyers  
   - Premium positioning for luxury car customers
